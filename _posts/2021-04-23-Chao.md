#### **A Seemingly Homogenous in Singapore**

When hearing the name Singapore, it's likely to inspire an image of a tiny but prosperous country not only rich in business, but also in the aspect of ethnicity.
<br/>
<br/>
Made up of Chinese, Malay, Indian and various other ethnicities, this island-type immigrant society is what makes Singapore a unique set of diverse cultures coexisting in one country.
<br/>
<br/>
In 1965 when the country became independent, Mr Lee Kuan Yew said it is "not a Malay nation, not a Chinese nation, not an Indian nation. Everybody will have a place in Singapore”. So compared to the racial segregation maps of American cities, Singapore shows an obvious pattern of homogeneity.
<br/>
<br/>
This is because Singapore also shares the imagination of "melting pot", a powerful image of a pluralistic society; an integrated and mixed country; a platform where different races, cultures and identities are not only free to co-exist, but also to mingle and blend, to merge and combine. Some people even proclaim, with glee or with horror, that Singapore will one day consist solely of expatriates and immigrants.

#### Revelation in A Gentle Way  


To make these migrant labor more visible, but also avoid their exposure to the government, a way is to find some facts closely related to daily life, apart from the controlled housing and language. As a result,  religion and food are taken into consideration. More specifically, temples and hawker centers as the spatial representation of religion and food culture are perfect for mapping.

For many transnational workers, migration to Singapore is probably the first time they’ve stepped out of their country. Take the low-wage Indian and Bangladeshi workers for example, they’ve been left out of society and suffering from nostalgia, thus Little India became the ideal place providing homely feelings for comfort.

Prior to Singapore’s independence in 1959, the British colonial government segregated the various races into specific locations across the island. The Chinese lived in the downtown area, the Malays in Kampong Glam and Geylang Serai, and the Indians in Serangoon and Sembawang. This segregation was thought to be one of the reasons for the racial riots that occurred in 1964.

#### **Neighborhood: hawker center and modern enclave**  


Hawker centers are food courts that house many stalls selling a variety of cuisines, typically found throughout singapore and near public housing. In addition, hawker centers are the first choice for the migrant workers who have relatively low income. So the data from hawker centers can make this population visible in maps.

**Heterotopia in singapore**

Geylang area is a special area with the only legal red light district, foreign domestic helper dormitories, karaoke lounges, etc. in Singapore which is in sharp contrast to the image of a "garden city" given by Singapore. After the British colonial government moved the Malays and indigenous people from the mouth of the Singapore River to Geylang in the early years of the opening of the port, this area became a concentration of Malays in Singapore. There have been many pure Malay areas, such as Kampong Melayu (Malay Village). Now it has gradually become a gathering place for a large number of foreign guest workers and tourists.
<br/>
<br/>
**More job opportunities**
The Geylang area has gradually become one of the must-visit neighbourhoods for tourists in Singapore because of the large number of snacks and hawker centers. In addition, many small temples, guild halls, Buddhist associations and civil society have also moved to the Geylang area, which has led scale of the night market getting bigger and bigger.
There are nearly 1,000 stalls in Geylang nowadays. In other words, to make the night market open, at least 3,000 workers are needed to help. The monthly rent for the stalls ranges from S$3,000 (RM9,300) to S$15,000 (RM46,500). In order to solve the shortage of manpower and save expenses, many stall owners do not hesitate to hire Migrant workers who only have Travel visa. The night market has been banned 76 times, and the spokesperson of Singapore government said that 257 “illegal” workers have been arrested in the past two years.
Most of them came from neighboring countries such as Malaysia and entered Singapore on social and tourist visas.
A reporter from The Straits Times of Singapore went to the night market to investigate and found that before the market opened, about 10 foreign men "beating the floor" slept in the stalls overnight, hanging their clothes on the railings. When the reporter tried to find out about the situation with several men, Found that none of them speak English.
<br/>
<br/>
**Where do they live**
Singapore is said to have the most cost-effective housing conditions. However, the HDB housing policy has not benefited foreign workers, but it has further caused segragetion of foreign workers. HDB flats are public housing in Singapore. More than 80% of locals live in HDB flats. Some homeowners will sublet the room at home and live with their tenants. The Housing and Development Board of Singapore stipulates the number of guests that can be rented in accordance with the types of HDB flats. For example, a 4-room HDB cannot rent more than 6 non-blood relatives. The purpose is to "maintain a good quality of life." However, there are few tenants and the rent to be shared is relatively high. For foreign workers living in a foreign country, renting a bed allows them to save more savings. Therefore, there will be a large number of stickers on the walls of Geylang Street. Malay-language rental advertisements; these dormitories are almost illegally over-rented. The limited indoor space is filled with bunk beds and it is impossible to put them on the rental website. The high-density ancestral homes in Geylang and Hokkien-style townhouses provide many foreign workers with more private, safe, independent and cheap living spaces.

**Migrant workers from South Asian**

"Little India" is a community full of Indian style with many shops and restaurants. At the weekend, Little India was packed with people, and South Asian workers from Bangladesh and India gathered here to spend their time.
Except for some of them with high academic qualifications and working in large enterprises, most of them are engaged in low-skilled jobs that Singaporeans do not want to do, including junior construction workers, truck drivers, and cleaners. The monthly salary is more than 1500-2500 SGD. It is clearly a low-income group in Singapore. There are also some workers who choose to smuggle and resell electronic products such as mobile phones to make a profit.
<br/>
<br/>
**Alcohol and emotional depression**

According to Lianhe Wanbao, there were less than 10 wineries in Little India 5 years ago, and there were not so many guest workers who came to Little India at that time. Nowadays, the number and density of bars near Little India far exceeds that of downtown Singapore. Because this business is so attractive, more and more businesses have joined the ranks of wine sellers in recent years to grab a share of the pie.
According to shicheng news, a winery can sell 6000 SGD wine in 7 hours on Sunday alone! Foreign workers account for about 70% of the customers of these wineries. The social ethos of migrant workers gathering and alcoholism may be the culprit of the 2013 Little India riot.

<br/>
<br/>
**2013 Little India riot**
At 21:23 pm Singapore time, an Indian guest worker was killed on the spot after being knocked down by a private bus at the intersection of Race Course Rd and Hampshire Rd in Little India. This caused dissatisfaction among workers and passers-by. The crowd surrounded and attacked the vehicle. The police car and the ambulance that arrived later. More than 300 foreign guest workers participated in the incident, and the riot lasted for more than two hours. Singapore’s "Lianhe Zaobao" quoted police sources on the 9th that an Indian worker was killed by a bus at the intersection of Paomapo Road and Hansa Road on the evening of the 8th. Due to the large number of onlookers, most of whom were foreign workers from South Asia, the emotions of the personnel rapidly intensified. Onlookers started attacking medical staff and police with wine bottles and some flower pots placed in nearby shops, smashing police cars. Injured 27 police officers and 12 members of the Civil Defense Forces, and several police cars and ambulances were burned.
Although Yi Huaren, Minister of the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Trade and Industry, emphasized that the Little India riots were "isolated incidents" and should not lead to xenophobic sentiments.
However, the media and online comments believe that there may be deeper reasons for the riots, including Singapore’s over-reliance on foreign workers, the government’s failure to immediately detect the problems that may be caused by the gathering of guest workers, and the accumulation of dissatisfaction among guest workers in the face of unequal treatment by employers mood.
This incident is the second riot since Singapore's independence, and the first riot in more than 40 years after the ethnic riots in 1969.
Billville Singh, an associate professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, believes that the riots may be a watershed, and such incidents may happen one after another in the future, because “Singaporeans will become more and more insecure and  narrow nationalism when their confidence about multiculturalism declines in the future.

#### **Now 31+%, Once 100%**


Singapore is a country built on migrant workers, while Singaporean citizens are living upon privileged ignorance against them. Such ambivalent attitude is rooted in the structural inequalities hidden behind governmental compulsory policies and the seemingly homogeneous census.

For decades, the old enclaves were demolished and gone, but right on Singapore’s road to multiculturalism, there are actually new ones forming. Because the migrant workers find it no leeway to integrate into a wider context and they have been experiencing marginalization throughout history.

As a result, it’s necessary to unmask official data, reveal the plight of this invisible population and show the future possible segregation.
