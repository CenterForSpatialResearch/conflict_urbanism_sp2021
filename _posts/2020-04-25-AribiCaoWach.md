![Black, White, Red, & Blue: Representing the Black Electorate of Georgia, After Dubois](/conflict_urbanism_sp2021/images/BWRB/001.png)

*The results of the 2020 election represented many things around the nation. In Georgia, the general and runoff elections became a significant occurrence, with the states flip from red to blue. Looking forward, this could represent a model to analyze shifting demographics throughout the US. Overall, these changes will have far-reaching effects on local, state, and national politics.*

*Black White Red & Blue; Representing the Black electorate of Georgia After Dubois looks to analyze and compare Georgia's demographics and voting patterns for the 2020 election year through the reinterpretation of W. E. B. Du Bois’ data portraits in his Exposition des Nègres d'Amerique in 1900.*

#### Introduction

On March 25th, 2021, Republican Governor Brian Kemp of the state of Georgia signed the 95-page Law, SB 202, or the Election Integrity Act of 2021, less than two hours after both houses of the state legislature passed it. According to the ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union), this law violates voters’ first, fourteenth, and fifteenth amendments as well as the Voting Rights Act. Some changes from this law involve criminalizing line warming, which is when a person or an organization provides food and/or resources to voters waiting in line, additional more stringent voter ID requirements, and changes to the absentee and early voting processes. It is currently being challenged by several organizations such as Black Votes Matter and the ACLU on the grounds of voter suppression and civil infringement.

As this next attempt of voter suppression occurs, and with its long history in this state, we look back on W. E. B. Du Bois’ 1900 The Exhibit of American Negroes, and exploration of Georgia demographics and how it relates to today, and more specifically the year 2020.

#### The Year Georgia Flipped: The 2020 Election

These policies come to light at a time when Georgia has become a particularly heated arena for conflicting political ideals over the past years. President Biden won both the 2020 election in November in addition to the runoff elections this past January, a historic moment for the state, as the last Democratic presidential candidate to win in Georgia was Clinton in ‘92, followed by almost two decades of consistent Republican backing.
Undoubtedly, these new measures to complicate democracy come partially in response to the unexpected flip of the historically red state to blue. The traditional notion of Georgia as a “solid” red state, however, masks the perseverance of a strong Democratic votership within Georgia throughout its history, which was able to culminate into a majority this past year.

#### The 1900 Exposition des Nègres d'Amerique

“At the 1900 Paris Exposition, the famed sociologist and civil rights activist W. E. B. Du Bois presented a series of groundbreaking data visualizations advocating for African American progress. These graphs, charts, and maps provided powerful glimpses into the lives of black Americans to convey both a literal and figurative representation of what Du Bois famously referred to as ‘the color line.” From advances in education to the lingering effects of slavery, these infographics-- beautiful in design and impactful in content-- made visible a wide spectrum of black experiences.”

*-- Princeton Architectural Press*

In this study, we find that the blue votership of Georgia is deeply ingrained within its Black population, one whom DuBois would refer to as a “small nation of people studying, examining, and thinking of their own progress and prospects” over a century ago through the data portraits featured at the 1900 Paris exhibition.

More than a simple sociological study, Dubois’ display addressed a crisis of representation, refuting the racist institutions within Europe of the time and establishing a place for black Americans in modern, international society. We find the simplification of Georgia as a “red state” to be contrary to this work.

In later writings, Dubois foretold that the problem of the color line dividing both the people and outcomes of white and Black communities would be one of the primary problems the twentieth century would have to grapple with.

#### The Color Line of Race & Party

From our own analysis, we can confirm the legacy of spatial patterns produced by racial hegemony in the US. In the middle region of the state, similarities still persist between the percentage of enslaved persons in 1860 and the percentage of black residents according to the most recent 2018 Census.

Fragments of Georgia’s ‘Black Belt,’ as it would come to be known, continue to exist today, not ignoring, however, the effect of the Great Migration over much of the 20th-century in addition to the growing significance of Atlanta as a center for entrepreneurship in contemporary times.

-----------------------

This document contains instructions for how to create a page on this website.

The template for this website was developed by the [Columbia Center for Spatial Research](c4sr.columbia.edu) (CSR) based on the Minima [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme in order to facilitate creating collaborative student publications in our seminars each year.

This document is written as a tutorial for students taking courses that use this template to produce a collaborative web publication.

It will walk you through how to compose a post using a simple markup language called markdown. And then how to upload it to this website which is hosted on GitHub.

The class website you will collectively contribute to is built using a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). For more on what Jekyll is or how to use it to build your own website please refer to this great tutorial from the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages).
For more information on how the CSR template is set up please see the README [here](/README.md).

This tutorial accomplishes two things:
  - you will become familiar with editing and composing documents using markdown syntax.
  - you will create a template document for your final project that you can edit in order to publish your final project.


#### Before you begin
**Create a GitHub Account**  
1. visit [github.com](https://github.com/) and sign up for a Github account if you do not already have one
2. ask to be added as a contributor to the repository for your class's website if you are not already
**Download and install the text editor of your choice**
1. to create your post you will compose a plain text document. To do this you can use Notepad on Windows or Text Editor on Mac, however there are a number of great text editors out there that will help make things easier. [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) are two good options. Download and install one of these if you would like.

#### Step 1: familiarize yourself with the structure of the site
1. in a browser open both the GitHub repository and the class website (your professor should have given you links to both). The two pages will look something like this:
![screenshot of repository and class website]
1. this GitHub repository is currently hosting a simple website. If you have already been added as a collaborator to the repository, click on the repository's `Settings` and scroll down to the `GitHub Pages` section locate the URL of the site. Or ask the owner of the repository to send you the link. Navigate to this website to take a look at it.
2. the simple website you just visited above is being hosted by this repository. Scroll up to look at the structure of the folders and files. Key things to note here:
    - the `_includes`, `_layout`, `_sass`, and `assets` folders contain the files that define the CSR template. You will not need to change any files inside these folders
    - the `images` folder is where any images that you include in the website should be placed
    - the `_posts` folder is what contains the markdown files that will become individual pages on the website.

#### Step 2: compose a new post
1. open the `_posts` folder. Each page on the website is made by producing a new file in the `_posts` folder of the repository.
2. open one of the `.md` files and select `Raw` which will allow you to view the unformatted file
3. this is written in markdown, and has a special header which is used by the template to (1) format the page's title & author, (2) populate the homepage of the site with an image, and title. The header looks something like this:
          ```
          ---
          layout: post
          date:   2020-01-01
          image: "/your-site-name/images/csr_thumbnail.png"
          title:  "Template Post: Title of Your Final Project"
          author: "Names Of Everyone In Your Group"
          ---
          ```
4. the body of the post has sample text showing the simple markdown syntax. [This webpage](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is also a good resource as it provides a comprehensive guide to markdown syntax
5. open the text editor of your choice (we suggest either [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), download one of these if you haven't already)
6. create a new empty file in your text editor
7. **Copy** all of the raw markdown from `.md` file in this repository and **paste** it in to this empty file.
8. Save the file in the following format `2020-01-03-lastname.md`
9. once you save the file your text editor will recognize you are writing in markdown and will start highlighting the special syntax of this language:
![syntax highlight]
10. now we will edit this file to get familiar with how to write in markdown
11. edit the document's header (the area highlighted in a magenta dashed line above).
    - layout should stay labeled as post: `layout: post`
    - change the date to today's date
    - leave the image as-is for now
    - change the title to your uni:  `title:  "xyz2222"`
    - change the author to your name: `author: "Jane Adams"`

12. edit the document to practice formatting text and including links. Write in the document so you have:
    - a paragraph of text (use your final project proposal)
    - a word in bold,
    - a word in italics
    - a link to the github repository for the tutorials for this class
    - (optional) an iframe with the webmap you created in tutorial 4 or 5 embedded

13. embed an image in your post. This is a two step process
**Step one:** you must upload your image to a folder in the class website Github repository.
**Step two:** you must link to that image from within your post.

    1. find an image that is in the [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) or for which you have image rights.  
    2. save the image with a reasonable file name (you might as a class want to decide on a convention here like `lastname_description.jpg`)
    3. upload the image to the `images` folder in the Github repository for your site
    ![image upload]
    4. After dragging the image file you have chosen into the uploader, enter a descriptive caption for your commit, and select `Commit Changes`
    5. Check the folder to verify that the image was uploaded
**Now we'll embed the image in to the body of your post.**
    1. You'll use the following syntax:  `![description of image](/your-site-name/images/lastname_description.jpg)` replace `your-site-name` with the name of the repository for the site, and replace `lastname_description.jpg` with the file name of the image you just uploaded
    - note: the information between the [ ] contains a description of the image that gets used by screen readers to make your website more accessible
    - the information in the () contains the path to the image within our website
      **Note** the file path must start with a `/` i.e. it must be something like `/your-site-name/images/` if you do not include the `/` then the link will not work.
14. save your post
15. now replace the thumbnail image that appears on the course website landing page. This image, currently a placeholder, is defined in the header of your post. To change it you will need to first choose and upload an image, and then change the link in the yaml header

    1. choose an image that is representative of your project, crop it to have a **square** aspect ratio that is at least 300px wide

    2. just like you did in step 13 above upload this image to the `images` folder

    3. update the yaml header of your post, replace the path in the `image` field to match the repository name and file name of the square image you just uploaded to github. Just like above, replace `your-project-name` with the name of your site's repository, and replace `lastname_description2.png` with the name of the square image you just uploaded:
    ```
    ---
    layout: post
    date:   2019-03-20
    image: "/your-project-name/images/lastname_description2.png"
    title:  "Provisional Title of Your Final Project"
    author: "Names Of Everyone In Your Group"
    ---
    ```
16. **Save your post**

#### Step 3: upload your post to the repository
Now we will `commit` this new post to the group repository which will mean that is becomes visible on the group website.

1. navigate to the `_posts` folder of the repository. And select `Upload Files`. Drag the markdown file containing your post to the window. Write a commit message, and commit your post
2. wait 1-2 minutes, then visit/refresh the class website URL. Your post should have appeared

#### Step 4: making changes to/editing your post
To update your post after you have made changes to your markdown file in your text editor:
1. Navigate to the `_posts` folder in the repository

2. Select `Upload Files` as you did in step 3 above. **Note: make sure that you did not change the name of your file**. Drag the markdown file containing your post into the window. Write a commit message and commit your post

3. Wait 1-2 minutes, then visit/refresh the class website URL. The updates to your post should have appeared
