#### Investigating how Elements within the Built Environment Heighten Police Violence : 38th St & Chicago Ave, Minneapolis, The Murder of George Floyd


The built environment has been a constant character in the story of violence against black bodies here in the US. The idea of space and who has access to it, in what manner and at what times is at the center of this story as well. The most persistent space that African Americans have demanded to be a part of is the ideological landscape of American Democracy these ideological battles however, manifest themselves in the material world in spaces that have been perceived as the singular dominion of white people. Wherever we look the built environment is there. Often, we have seen the built environment used as a tool against the African-American and other marginalized communities. The two elements at play here are the built environment and the police. First the slave catcher, then the overseer, and finally the police officer, have always been charge with the responsibility of limiting the free movement of black people in America. They have been charged with protecting property and space and the result of this intense interaction is often death. The events surrounding the murder of George Floyd resemble many other murders of unarmed black men, boys, women and girls by the police. The setting is often similar and the perpetrator is constant. The story of George Floyd is not unique, however the response of the masses has caused the world to take a closer look at the relationship of the police and state violence against black people. We are well aware of the social and economic conditions that require the police to occupy communities of color and abuse its residents. But now we will explore what are the elements of the built environment that heighten the possibility of negative interaction between the police and people of color.

We contend that the spatial violence of defensive architecture, *CPTED measures*, along with historical racist land use controls such as racial covenants, and urban renewal projects such as highways, while not directly responsible for the death of George Floyd set the proverbial stage for his death.

**George Floyd lived and died in a place that was sterile and hostile to members of his community.**
