The project researches spatial data about Climate, Conflict and Migration in relation to the absence of a legal definition of the concept of “Climate Refugee”. 

#### The Problem: The absence of a legal framework for climate refugees

The question that triggered this research project is that in spite of the apparent evidence of the role that climate change plays in forcing massive migrations, there is neither a clear definition for this category of people, nor an international formal recognition that guarantees the rights of affected populations to protection and asylum, and that ascribes the responsibility of the developed countries and the Global North (it is, the main emitters of greenhouse gases) towards the problem. However, as recognized by Jean-Claude Juncker (European Commission President) at State of the Union speech in 2015 “Climate change is one of the root causes of a new migration phenomenon. Climate refugees will become a new challenge – if we do not act swiftly” .

The gap at the current legal framework, the 1951 Refugee Convention, is that it applies only to “people who have a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, and are unable or unwilling to seek protection from their home countries''. This leaves outside the people displaced for reasons related to the environment or climate change, who are mainly categorized as “Internally Displaced Persons” (IDP). Yet, “the distinction between refugees and internally displaced persons is a fundamental and integral characteristic of traditional refugee law defining the extent to which assistance will be made available to displaced persons”. As Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, former UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has argued, Climate Change is mainly causing internal displacements, nevertheless, when “they cross a border, they will not be considered refugees”. This means that they cannot easily appeal for resettlement in another country, and they remain trapped in worsening environmental conditions.

At the light of the estimation made by The International Organization for Migration (IOM) that there could be as many as 200 million such refugees by 2050, and although some efforts have been made, the question still remains: 

**Why if there is so much evidence for the need of a legal framework, there is still not such a legal definition for “climate refugees”?**

#### The complexities: Establishing clear causal relationships

Our research has proved to us that the main problem under the definition for “Climate Refugees” is that of establishing clear causal relationships between climate change, migration and conflicts, since most of the time causal connections are intertwined or disguised behind another in many different and complicated ways.

Despite the growing consensus in scholarly literature regarding the evidence for climate-induced migration, there is less consensus regarding the existence of climate-induced conflicts. For example, it is sometimes argued that “Climate change may not of itself trigger a movement of people” or that “it does not necessarily cause people to take arms”, and that social, political and economic factors need to be taken into account to explain people’s decisions to migrate. 

Nevertheless, it has been claimed that “given the likelihood that environmental change, migration, and conflict may happen in close proximity or succession, there is a need to more explicitly connect the three phenomena”, and also that “the spatial dimension is necessary for analyzing the connections between climate-related environmental change and violent battles”. Therefore, we intend to contribute mostly to the spatial research with this project.

#### The Research: Three case studies in the Sahel, África

We are centering our research in the area that has been pointed out to be more acutely affected by climate change: The Sahel area in Africa, and more in detail at three case studies in Nigeria and its border with Niger, namely Sokoto and Zamfara, Benue and Lake Chad.

The reason to select these 3 case studies is that they present 3 different types of climate induced conflicts (Cattle rustling and rural banditry, Farmer-Herder conflicts, and Boko Haram) and patterns of migration (transnational migration, internal displacement)

Moreover, being aware that climate, conflict and migration are intertwined in many complex and different ways, to look at the causal relations among them will also prevent us from having a biased understanding of the issue. 
The question for all of them is, can we call them climate refugees?

#### SOKOTO-ZAMFARA

Sokoto and Zamfara regions of Nigeria experience an unprecedented crisis of multiple types of conflicts: local community conflicts, criminal gang practices and jihadists fought by state militia. In the past, disputes over land and natural resources have been a constant element of the annual seasonal cycle and were always resolved by local-community authorities. 
Recently, the regular conflicts were exacerbated by increasing water scarcity (shortening of rain period), resulting in desertification of farmland, coinciding with rapidly increasing fertility rates among Sokoto and Zamfara women. The competition for land suitable for both farming and grazing became hostile - Fulani herders were further deprived of rights to use forest lands, given by the newly elected democratic government in 1999 to Hausa farmers, many of which were particularly favored by the Abuja officials. 

Conflicts so abundant, that state cannot handle them -> Hausa vigilantes attacking random perceived perpetrators and Fulani Gangs attacking, kidnapping etc. Zamfara State adopted Islamic Law in 2000, as a way to tackle the economic crisis. State perceives conflicts happening in Zamfara as Zamfara’s business. 
Local conflicts - opened way for gangs and jihadists. Many displaced internally, many moved to Niger. 
Migration usually is said to happen right after an attack and from small villages to cities.

#### THE MIDDLE BELT- BENUE STATE

This case study explores the farmers and herders’ conflict in Nigeria. It is caused by the advance of drought desertification in the north forcing Fulani people and other pastoral communities to migrate towards the south in search for alternative pastures and sources of water for their cattle. When the herders arrive to the lands of the Middle Belt (Benue, Plateau, Adamawa, Nasarawa and Taraba states), they have to compete for these resources. In a context of scarcity, it is leading to conflict between the local farmers and the newly arrived herders.
We consider that this is an important case study because the causal connection from climate change leading to migration is very clear, nevertheless the causal connection of climate change leading to conflict has been pointed out to need further spatial study. (which is with what we want to contribute here. Paper: Spatial pattern of climate change and farmer–herder conflict vulnerabilities in Nigeria, published in GeoJurnal last year). Moreover, the farmer-herder conflict has become Nigeria’s gravest security challenge, now claiming far more lives than the Boko Haram insurgency.
In terms of its timeline, this conflict in Nigeria has a long history, nevertheless the conflict started worsening in 2014, and Benue has been pointed out to be the most impacted state by the farmer-herder conflict, possibly due to the new laws banning open grazing in Benue and Taraba states. and especially around the Guma and Logo communities where many farming households were displaced and lived in government provided Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps for many months.

#### LAKE CHAD BASIN

Africa’s Lake Chad is the convergence point of a complex humanitarian disaster courtesy of violence, climate change, and remote, ungoverned areas. For almost two decades, the Lake Chad Basin (LCB) in general, and northeast Nigeria in particular have been subject to the insurgency of the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram. This region is also known for its poor environmental conditions that mostly manifest in land desertification and water scarcity. Water scarcity and land desertification play in the decision of local people to migrate.

The decrease of the discharge from the Komadugu Yobe River, which serves as a supply channel for water. The water resources of the LCB provide livelihoods to a population of more than 45 million people, of which 60% rely on agriculture. 

(204) Internally displaced persons (IDPs) at the Bakassi IDP camp in Maiduguri between
March and May 2019 come from Guzamala, Gwoza, Marte, Monguno, and Nganzai (were interviewed).

Experts say climate change is a key factor fuelling the insurgency of the armed group Boko Haram, which is aimed at creating an Islamic State in North East Nigeria.

North East Nigeria used to be peaceful with more than 50 percent of the population making a living from farming, fishing and livestock production. Many people in the region lost their livelihoods following increasing aridity caused by climate change, hence becoming vulnerable to being recruited by Boko Haram (recruited targets due to loss of livelihood).
