This project investigates publicly accessible spatial data on climate, conflict and migration, in relation to the absence of a legal definition of the term “climate refugee”. For this purpose, the work focuses on three case studies in the Sahel Region in Central Africa, where arguable climate-induced mass migration and conflict is taking place. The objective is to explore spatial complexities of establishing causal relationships between the three phenomena and develop a framework for further research, as well as contribute to the discussion on how climate migration can be addressed in terms of policy.


:-:## **The Problem: The absence of a legal framework for climate refugees**

The problem that triggered this research is that, in spite of the apparent evidence of the role that climate change plays in forcing massive migrations, there is neither a clear definition for this category of migrants, nor an international formal recognition that guarantees the rights of affected populations to protection and asylum and that ascribes the responsibility of the developed countries and the Global North (it is, the main emitters of greenhouse gases) towards the problem. However, as recognized by Jean-Claude Juncker (European Commission President) at State of the Union speech in 2015 “Climate change is one of the root causes of a new migration phenomenon. Climate refugees will become a new challenge – if we do not act swiftly”.

The gap in the current legal framework, the 1951 Refugee Convention, limits the term to  only apply to “people who have a well-founded fear of being persecuted because of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, and are unable or unwilling to seek protection from their home countries”.This excludes the people displaced for reasons related to the environment degradation and climate change, who are mainly categorized as Internally Displaced Persons (IDP). Yet, “the distinction between refugees and internally displaced persons is a fundamental and integral characteristic of traditional refugee law defining the extent to which assistance will be made available to displaced persons”. As Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, former UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has argued that climate change is mainly causing internal displacements, nevertheless, “when they cross a border, they will not be considered refugees”. This means that they cannot easily appeal for resettlement in another country. Instead, heir actions are criminalized as they seek to leave the worsening environmental conditions.

In light of the recent estimation made by The International Organization for Migration (IOM), there could be as many as **200 million such refugees by 2050.** Although some efforts have been made to reach a possible legal definition, the question still remains: ***Why is there still no legal definition of the term climate refugee, when all the evidence indicates a dire need for such a framework?***


### **The complexities: Establishing clear causal relationships**

In our investigation, one of the main problems in defining “climate refugee” is not being able to establish **the existence and shape of the causal relationship between climate change, migration and conflicts**, since most of the time causal connections are intertwined or disguised behind one another in many different and complicated ways.

Despite the growing consensus in scholarly literature regarding the evidence for climate-induced migration, there is less consensus regarding the existence of climate-induced conflicts. For example, it is sometimes argued that “climate change may not of itself trigger a movement of people” or that “it does not necessarily cause people to take arms”, and that social, political and economic factors need to be taken into account to explain people’s decisions to migrate. 

Nevertheless, it has been also argued that “given the likelihood that environmental change, migration, and conflict may happen in close proximity or succession, there is a need to more explicitly connect the three phenomena”, and also that **“the spatial dimension is necessary for analyzing the connections between climate-related environmental change and violent battles”**.

With this project, we intend to contribute mostly to the research on possible methodologies of data spatialization, in order to portray the relations between the 3 types of phenomena.


#### The Project: Three case studies in the Sahel, Africa

We are centering our research in the Sahel area, since it has been pointed out to be the most acutely affected region by climate change in the world, and more in detail at three regions in Nigeria, namely **Sokoto and Zamfara, Benue and Lake Chad**.

The reason to select these three particular case studies is that they present different types of climate induced conflicts (Cattle rustling and rural banditry, Farmer-Herder conflicts, and Boko Haram) and patterns of migration (transnational migration, internal displacement). Additionally, to look at the causal relations in three different places will prevent us from having a biased understanding of the matter. 

The question for all of them is, **can we call them climate refugees?**


#### SOKOTO-ZAMFARA

Sokoto and Zamfara regions of Nigeria experience an unprecedented crisis of multiple types of conflicts: local community conflicts, criminal gang practices and jihadists fought by state militia. In the past, disputes over land and natural resources have been a constant element of the annual seasonal cycle and were always resolved by local-community authorities. 
Recently, the regular conflicts were exacerbated by increasing water scarcity (shortening of rain period), resulting in desertification of farmland, coinciding with rapidly increasing fertility rates among Sokoto and Zamfara women. The competition for land suitable for both farming and grazing became hostile - Fulani herders were further deprived of rights to use forest lands, given by the newly elected democratic government in 1999 to Hausa farmers, many of which were particularly favored by the Abuja officials. 

Conflicts so abundant, that state cannot handle them -> Hausa vigilantes attacking random perceived perpetrators and Fulani Gangs attacking, kidnapping etc. Zamfara State adopted Islamic Law in 2000, as a way to tackle the economic crisis. State perceives conflicts happening in Zamfara as Zamfara’s business. 
Local conflicts - opened way for gangs and jihadists. Many displaced internally, many moved to Niger. 
Migration usually is said to happen right after an attack and from small villages to cities.

#### THE MIDDLE BELT: BENUE STATE

**Timeframe**: 2014 - peak in 2018 - Present

**Type of Scenario**: Scarcity + Environmental degradation as method of conflict

**Causal relationship**: Climate change (drought and desertification) -> migration (?) conflict -> displacement (IDP Camps + Host Communities)

**Description**: This case study explores the farmers and herders’ conflict in Nigeria. It is caused by the advance of drought and desertification in the north forcing Fulani people and other pastoral communities to migrate towards the south in search for alternative pastures and sources of water for their cattle. When the herders arrive to the lands of the Middle Belt they have to compete for these resources in a context of scarcity, which is leading to conflict between the local farmers and the newly arrived herders. The farmers and herders’ conflict has become Nigeria’s gravest security challenge, now claiming far more lives than the Boko Haram insurgency. Benue has been pointed out to be the most impacted state, due to the new laws banning open grazing in Benue and Taraba states. In terms of its timeline, the conflict started worsening in 2014, reaching its peak in January 2018 after the attacks on several Guma and Logo farmer communities.

While the causal connection from climate change in the north of Nigeria leading to migration to the south is very clear, the causal connection of climate change leading to conflict has been pointed out to need further spatial study. Therefore, we have spatially and chronologically mapped how the tree phenomena are interconnected, including testimonies of people that have been displaced to IDP Camps or host communities due to the conflict.

#### LAKE CHAD BASIN

Africa’s Lake Chad is the convergence point of a complex humanitarian disaster courtesy of violence, climate change, and remote, ungoverned areas. For almost two decades, the Lake Chad Basin (LCB) in general, and northeast Nigeria in particular have been subject to the insurgency of the Islamist terrorist group Boko Haram. This region is also known for its poor environmental conditions that mostly manifest in land desertification and water scarcity. Water scarcity and land desertification play in the decision of local people to migrate.

The decrease of the discharge from the Komadugu Yobe River, which serves as a supply channel for water. The water resources of the LCB provide livelihoods to a population of more than 45 million people, of which 60% rely on agriculture. 

(204) Internally displaced persons (IDPs) at the Bakassi IDP camp in Maiduguri between
March and May 2019 come from Guzamala, Gwoza, Marte, Monguno, and Nganzai (were interviewed).

Experts say climate change is a key factor fuelling the insurgency of the armed group Boko Haram, which is aimed at creating an Islamic State in North East Nigeria.

North East Nigeria used to be peaceful with more than 50 percent of the population making a living from farming, fishing and livestock production. Many people in the region lost their livelihoods following increasing aridity caused by climate change, hence becoming vulnerable to being recruited by Boko Haram (recruited targets due to loss of livelihood).

#### The Conclusion: More spatial research and personal testimonies

In this research we have learned the complexities that lay behind establishing a legal definition for the concept of “Climate Refugee” though three different case studies, which is that of establishing clear causal relationships between conflict, migration and climate change phenomena.

The absence of data regarding peoples’ migration patterns has been one of the major challenges in that research, which of course, responds to people's right to privacy, something we absolutely stand for. However, the spatial data we were able to collect, mainly about conflicts and displacement, has shown the diversity, scale and magnitude of the problem of climate-induced migration in Nigeria.

However, if the main conclusion we draw is that more spatial research is needed, we believe that the strategy of including displaced people's narratives and testimonies is not only a more humane way to address the problem, but also an effective complement to the data in order to trace the chain of events behind people’s decisions to migrate and show the connections that often remain obscure under (lacking) data points.
