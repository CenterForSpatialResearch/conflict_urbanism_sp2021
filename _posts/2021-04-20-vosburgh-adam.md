#### The Collapse of Corporate Infrastructure and the Resilience of Local Systems in the Hudson Valley

While food can transcend cultural boundaries, it is also a site of conflict. This research focuses on the superfluous nature of corporate supply chains. In this study, the broader systemic fractures of the food system are revealed through the examination of corporate infrastructures' role in exacerbating food insecurity in the Hudson Valley during the COVID-19 pandemic.  

## Food Insecurity  

Food insecurity is defined as a lack of consistent access to enough food for every person in a household to live an active, healthy life. This can be a temporary situation for a household or can last a long time. The coronavirus pandemic has compounded the patterns of vulnerability that cause food insecurity as schools closed and people lost their jobs.

This map will illustrate food insecurity rates pre/post covid once the data is released from Feeding America Foundation this week.

Infrastructure networks facilitate the flow of goods and allow for their exchange over space. These systems simultaneously reveal forms of political rationality that shape their terms of access. While food infrastructures promise development and stability, their breakdowns reveal unsustainable notions of progress and economic growth. The tension between promise and failure makes infrastructure a productive site for analysis.  

This diagram illustrates the increasing vulnerability of food the further it travels from its source and the apparatuses of infrastructural dependency embedded within food systems. A select few corporations have monopolized these networks, so when one fails, the ripple effects are felt throughout the country. This is the reason why most food has to travel at least 100 miles to be stocked right next to its source in Ulster County.  

In contrast, short food chains are being established, such as community supported agriculture, farmers markets, and food banks. This following research looks further into these grassroots organizing efforts and their fundamental role in the Hudson Valley’s food supply chain. 


## Apple Case Study  

![Apple Case Study](/conflict_urbanism_sp2021/images/FoodScarcity/images/applesToapples1.png)  

For example, here is a case study that compares two apples purchased in Kingston, New York. One is from Walmart, and the other is from the local farmers market. The vast difference in mileage required to produce the same apple in Kingston demonstrates the excessive nature of corporate supply chains.

![Kinston Nodes on Supply Chains](/conflict_urbanism_sp2021/images/FoodScarcity/maps/placeholder1.png)  

We mapped nodes on a long and short supply chain for Kingston, in this map red being for points on a long supply chain, yellow for short, orange for both.  

![Long Chain - Kingston](/conflict_urbanism_sp2021/images/FoodScarcity/maps/placeholder2.png)  

Nodes on a long chain are primarily grocery stores and big box retailers, Hanaford, Walmart, Target. We chose Walmart as a typical example of a long supply chain and looked into their supply chain.  

![Long Chain - Travel Distance](/conflict_urbanism_sp2021/images/FoodScarcity/maps/placeholder3.png)  

Going off of publicly accessible information and then phone calls to Walmart itself we were able to make a few decent assumptions. The trips on the journey for a longer supply chain is a farm, a processing facility, distribution center, and Walmart. Three of Walmarts main suppliers are located in Washington State, New York State, and Canada, and they are all owned by or subsidiaries of Super Fresh Growers. For the domestically sourced apples, the trip from Washington state is 2800 miles, and the average distance of Sweet Tango’s orchards (Sweet Tango is a subsidiary of Super Fresh Growers) is about 250 miles, all of their farms are located near the Canadian border. The Walmart distribution centers themselves are located in clusters around Schenectady and Scranton, 80 miles from Kingston. These long chains, supposedly the result of market efficiencies, instead express the logic of consolidated ownership structures.  

![Short Chain - Kingston](/conflict_urbanism_sp2021/images/FoodScarcity/maps/placeholder4.png)  

Items that fall on a short chain for Kingston are farms, local distribution centers, food pantries and farmers markets. We chose Kingston farmers market as an example.  

![Short Chain - Travel Distance](/conflict_urbanism_sp2021/images/FoodScarcity/maps/placeholder5.png)  

A primary orchard that sells its produce at Kingston Farmers market is Maynard farms, an 8 mile drive away. Maynard farms is one of thousands of small or mid-sized hudson valley farms whose produce are left out of larger supply chains because of their lack of access to large distributors, resulting in these “short chains” that are made through direct community links as an alternative infrastructure. The result of a food system running at peak market efficiency for consolidated actors is grocery stores stocked with products not from the incredible agricultural wealth they are surrounded by, the pricing of which makes them unaffordable to over 10% of the population.

## Forms of Resistance  

Forms of resistance to corporate supply chains include grassroots organization, local food pantries, community fridges, farmers markets, and meal delivery services. When corporate supply chains such as Walmart collapsed during the Covid-19 pandemic, local systems were able to continue operating which created community resilience despite the circumstances.  

## Conclusion  

How does food infrastructure perform as a tool of soft power? Our research illuminates the increasing vulnerability of food the further it travels from its source and the apparatuses of infrastructural dependency embedded within the Hudson Valley food system. By examining infrastructure and the injustices within it, we hope to render visible the systemic issues present in our broader food systems. The Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated the inefficiencies and weaknesses within corporate food infrastructure, so the argument for a local, sustainable, and just food system becomes critical for our shared future.
