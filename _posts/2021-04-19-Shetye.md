#### The Ma'dān of the Iraqi Marshlands

Once known as the largest wetland system in Western Eurasia, the Iraqi marshlands consist of distinct but adjacent marshes, the *Central Marshes*, *Hawaizah Marshes* and *Hammar Marshes*, providing habitats for several Marsh Arab tribes and a variety of non-human populations.  

Located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Southern Iraq, the marshlands are aquatic landscapes that are historically inhabited by the Marsh Arabs, also known as Ma'dān. Living in homes on floating islands, both made up of reeds, the livelihood of the Ma'dān consisted of fishing, rice cultivation and breeding livestock, and was highly in tuned to flood environments of the marshlands.

The unique geographical location of their habitat, however, made them vulnerable to exploitation for agricultural irrigation and oil exploration within the country, as well as hydro-infrastructural operations in neighboring countries. Since the 1950s, several tribes of the Marsh Arabs or Ma'dān have been marginalized, through the process of modernization, eliminating the way of life that they have relied on for decades.  



***Environmental Refugee***  
  - People who had to leave their habitat, temporarily or permanently, because of a potential environmental hazard or disruption in their life-supporting ecosystems.  
  El-Hinnawai (1985)  

  - Persons who no longer gain a secure livelihood in their traditional homelands because of what are primarily environmental factors of unusual scope.  
  Meyers & Kent (1995,18)

#### Drainage of the Marshlands  

The Marshlands have held a strong ecological significance in Iraq's history beginning from the country's process of modernization in the 1950s, the Iraq-Iran war in the 1980s, through the tumultuous presidency of Suddam Hussein in the 1990s, and into the current instability of the region.  

The Marshlands key location between the Tigris and Euphrates River basins made it susceptible to the process of modernization brought on by the development of several dams for hydroelectrical power both within and outside the Iraqi borders. Since the 1950s, developments like these have placed several Ma'dān tribes under constant threat of relocation as changes of flow from both the rivers affect the overall water levels and vegetation within the marshes. The map below identifies the several dams that were built along the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers since the 1950s with direct effect on the Marshlands and it's tribes.

The marshlands continued to be targeted for draining in the 1970’s to 'reclaim' the wetlands for agricultural irrigation purposes. Environmental conditions within the marshlands reached its worst during the presidency of Suddam Hussein who used water control from the rivers as a political tool. Based on a design to construct a *Third River* by British engineer Frank Haigh in his Haigh Report for the Iraqi Government in 1951, a 565 km long canal (known as the Nasiriyah Drainage Pump Station) between Euphrates and Tigris was constructed during the 1990s in order to desalinate the Euphrates water, effectively draining water from the *Central Marshes* into the Persian Gulf. By the end of the decade, nearly 90% of the Marshlands were depleted, making them unable to sustain the livelihoods of the Ma'dān tribes and thus inhabitable.

#### International Interest

In the early 2000s, restoration efforts for the wetlands were being advocated by many Iraqis in exile. Initiatives like Green Iraq campaigned for the reflooding of the marshlands through the destruction of dams built by Hussein, in the hope to revitalize the lost ecosystems and bring about the re-entry of the Marsh Arabs into the wetlands.  

In her dissertation, 'Reconstructing life: Environment, Expertise, and Political Power in Iraq's Marshes', Bridget Lauren Guarasci, Ph.D. and Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Frank and Marshall College, identifies how the restoration initiative by *Green Iraq* began receiving international funding once the Marshes were titled as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and how international ecological surveying by UNEP of the site created data and maps that began to attract private sector stakeholders in the process of conservation.

Maps like the ones above show the increase in number of oilfields in the country since the US led occupation. They highlight unique locations of 'supergiant oilfields' in and around the Marshlands, which drew a lot of funding from international oil companies like Shell and Exxon Mobil in the hopes to get access to the oil resources through conservational attempts.
