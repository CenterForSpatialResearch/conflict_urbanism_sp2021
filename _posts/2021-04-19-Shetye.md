Once known as the largest wetland system in Western Eurasia, the Iraqi marshlands consist of distinct but adjacent marshes, the *Central Marshes*, *Hawaizah Marshes* and *Hammar Marshes*, providing habitats for several Marsh Arab tribes and a variety of non-human populations.  

Located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Southern Iraq, the marshlands are aquatic landscapes that are historically inhabited by the Marsh Arabs, also known as Ma'dﾄ］. Living in homes on floating islands, both made up of reeds, the livelihood of the Ma'dﾄ］ consisted of fishing, rice cultivation and breeding livestock, and was highly in tuned to flood environments of the marshlands.  

The unique geographical location of their habitat, however, made them vulnerable to exploitation for agricultural irrigation and oil exploration within the country, as well as hydro-infrastructural operations in neighboring countries. Since the 1950s, several tribes of the Marsh Arabs or Ma'dﾄ］ have been marginalized, through the process of modernization, eliminating the way of life that they have relied on for decades.  



***Environmental Refugee***  
  - People who had to leave their habitat, temporarily or permanently, because of a potential environmental hazard or disruption in their life-supporting ecosystems.  El-Hinnawai (1985)  

  - Persons who no longer gain a secure livelihood in their traditional homelands because of what are primarily environmental factors of unusual scope.  Meyers & Kent (1995,18)

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  


All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
