Opportunity Zones were created through the **2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act** to encourage long term investment in low income areas.To qualify as an Opportunity Zone, the census tract had to have an individual poverty rate of at least 20% and a median family income no greater than 80% of the area median. Nominated by individual states, with a minimum of 25 total eligible census tracts but not more than 25% of the total number of eligible census tracts within the state, 8,766 individual census tracts were certified as Opportunity Zones in the summer of 2018 by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. They are located in all 50 states, DC, and 5 US territories. 

Opportunity Zones receive Opportunity Funds, which allow a diverse range of investors to invest in the Opportunity Zone and support economic development in that census tract. Investors are incentivized to invest in Opportunity Funds because of two main tax benefits. Taxpayers can temporarily defer including capital gains that are reinvested in qualified opportunity funds from gross income. If the investment in a qualified opportunity fund is held for more than 10 years and until at least December 31, 2026, then taxpayers can permanently exclude capital gains from the sale or exchange of that investment. Depending on state requirements for the Opportunity Zones, taxpayers may be able to defer and exclude capital gains from state taxable income in addition to federal income, such as in New York. Opportunity Zone designations are effective until December 31, 2028; the deadline for investments made with eligible funds from a 1031 exchange or a sale is January 1, 2027. 

The Biden administration has not made an announcement on the continuation or elimination of Opportunity Zones. Although intended to empower low income neighborhoods and residents, relaxed guidelines on reporting, few restrictions on project types that can receive tax benefits, and inaccurate mapping due to unaccounted for factors have led the program to be exploited by wealthy investors more motivated by tax breaks than social development. On the campaign trail, President Biden had touted a reform program for opportunity zones that would 1) *require more reporting on the impacts of opportunity zone investments on communities* 2) *set up restrictions for what projects can receive the opportunity zone tax benefits based on impact data and* 3) *incentivize investors to bring in local community groups to facilitate economic benefits for residents of the zones.*

This is a document that is written in markdown. What is markdown? It is a 'markup language' that allows you to format plain text in a way that is easily converted to many different formats. For example, this document was written in markdown but will be used as an webpage and converted into HTML.  

To present and turn in your final projects for Conflict Urbanism: Puerto Rico Now you will be editing this template. You will include all of the text of your paper here, along with any and all images, maps, videos, or other materials that you produce.  

[This webpage](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) provides a comprehensive guide to markdown syntax. But to make things easier for you we are including a cheat sheet of the main things you need to know here.  

#### Please use level 4 headings for major section divisions  
(make sure to put two spaces after the end of the heading)

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  


All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
