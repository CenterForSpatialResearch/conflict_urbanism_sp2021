###### *Opportunity Zones Mapped in 2018*

#### Introduction : What are Opportunity Zones?

Opportunity Zones were created through the **2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act** to encourage long term investment in low income areas.To qualify as an Opportunity Zone, the census tract had to have **an individual poverty rate of at least 20% and a median family income no greater than 80% of the area median**. Nominated by individual states, with a minimum of 25 total eligible census tracts but not more than 25% of the total number of eligible census tracts within the state, **8,766 individual census tracts were certified as Opportunity Zones in the summer of 2018 by the U.S. Department of the Treasury**. They are located in all 50 states, DC, and 5 US territories. 

Opportunity Zones receive **Opportunity Funds**, which allow a diverse range of investors to invest in the Opportunity Zone and support economic development in that census tract. Investors are incentivized to invest in Opportunity Funds because of two main tax benefits. Taxpayers can temporarily defer including capital gains that are reinvested in qualified opportunity funds from gross income. If the investment in a qualified opportunity fund is held for more than 10 years and until at least December 31, 2026, then taxpayers can permanently exclude capital gains from the sale or exchange of that investment. Depending on state requirements for the Opportunity Zones, taxpayers may be able to defer and exclude capital gains from state taxable income in addition to federal income, such as in New York. **Opportunity Zone designations are effective until December 31, 2028; the deadline for investments made with eligible funds from a 1031 exchange or a sale is January 1, 2027.**

The Biden administration has not made an announcement on the continuation or elimination of Opportunity Zones. Although intended to empower low income neighborhoods and residents, relaxed guidelines on reporting, few restrictions on project types that can receive tax benefits, and inaccurate mapping due to unaccounted for factors have led the program to be exploited by wealthy investors more motivated by tax breaks than social development. On the campaign trail, President Biden had touted a reform program for opportunity zones that would

1. require more reporting on the impacts of opportunity zone investments on communities
2. set up restrictions for what projects can receive the opportunity zone tax benefits based on impact data 
3. incentivize investors to bring in local community groups to facilitate economic benefits for residents of the zones
